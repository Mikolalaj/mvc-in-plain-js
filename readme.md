# MVC implemented in plain TypeScript

It's a simple movie list app that I created to learn the MVC pattern using only plain TypeScript.

MVC is a pattern that implements three layers:
1. Model: the data.
2. View: the UI.
3. Controller: the logic.

The model never touches the view. The view never touches the model. The controller connects them.
